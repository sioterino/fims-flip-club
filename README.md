## What is Fim’s Flip Club?

- Active **session management** via sessionStorage
- **User statistics** are tracked and updated after each game
- Editable user credentials through a dedicated **Settings page**
- Three difficulty modes to choose from:
  - Easy (16 cards)
  - Medium (36 cards)
  - Hard (64 cards)
- Built-in **timer and scoring system**
- User interface and experience inspired by the FIM design language

## Flip. Match. Master the Board.

Each game begins with a randomized deck. The goal is to uncover and match character sticker pairs in the shortest time possible, using memory and strategy. Challenge yourself across modes and refine your focus with each playthrough.

## Tech Stack & Purpose

This project was created to explore and practice:
- **JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming** principles
- Interactive gameplay design through DOM manipulation
- Scalable game mode logic
- Web storage APIs (`localStorage` and `sessionStorage`)
- User interface design guided by LE SSERAFIM’s visual identity

---

## How User Accounts Work

- New users are created and stored in `localStorage`
- Logging in creates a `sessionStorage` session for that user
- Statistics such as best score, time, and games played are recorded
- Users may update their credentials via the in-game settings panel

All data remains local to the user's browser—no backend or cloud services are involved.
